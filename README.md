# TCP-MSG-Sender
A simple C# programm, that connects to a server via port 8888 and can transfer messages between clients.

## Hosting
You can use both Server- and Client-Version on any Win 10/11 machine.
Just execute the Server exe.
For hosting in your LAN you just need you local IP-Address, but when making it public, you'll need to make an Port-Exception in your routers firewall for port 8888 to the machine, protocoll is TCP.

## Connecting
When the Server is started you can type in the IP of the Server machine in the client executable, then it should connect. I haven't implemented a failsafe yet, so be careful 'till I fix it.


### Anyways - Have Fun!
